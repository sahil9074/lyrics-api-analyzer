I got it, I'll take us wherever\nI'm a staple in the game, all my papers together\nAnd my life is on display like Truman\nThey wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner\nMy exes made some of my favorite music\nI dated women from my favorite movies\nKarma's such a thing of beauty\nI'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it\nIt's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters\nI keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever\nI might take a breather but I won't ever leave you\nIf I was you, I wouldn't like me either\nYeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like39Embed"
