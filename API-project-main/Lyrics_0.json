from the Vava to Cinquante-Cinq, then back to the Vava\nIf you know, you know, baby, I don't, I don't know what to tell you\nYeah\nAyy\n\nLook\nLong way from Sette Mezzo\nMeet Tommaso and Ernesto\nShort rigatoni with the pesto\nThese verses are my manifesto\nHallways got an echo\nMe and Smiggz on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go\nCasual sex, I'm like, \"Fuck a dress code\"\nThe first martini is an espresso\nChill shot glasses with prosecco\nNiggas so ignorant in our hood, they b\u0435 like, \"Why the fuck you makin' techno?\"\nI'm worldwid\u0435 and this is just another cargo jet flow, I had to let go\nLife insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko\nI got some meaner threats, though\nMe, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow\nI had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo\nI'm losin' track of where we all go\nI wouldn't trade my life for none of y'alls, it's an embargo\nFifty-nine bags on the 767, this is heavy cargo\nYeah\nFifty-nine bags on the\u2014, ayy\nSwedish jail cell smellin' like some Carby Musk\nFor your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus\nBottle signs, club lines, should've come with us\nWe left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up\nI mean, these just my suggestions of course\nEmRata here fresh off divorce\nAnd I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse\nIf she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards\nI'm here for the moral support\nWhippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas\nBig Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers\nDrake, you got it\nRobert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic\nYou would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product\nTeachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff\nMight be the only teacher that gets paid enough\nThat's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods\nYou niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris\nIf we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs\nCome to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy\nFirst got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me\nNo chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy\nThey underestimated my trajectory\nBut now they gotta pay that shit direct to me\nI send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just\u2014\nIndependent women is lovin' the new appearance\nMatter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris\nLike, \"Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus\"\nI got my head in the clouds, I'm serious\nThe lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods\nPromise you'll get that shit when the sky clears\nThis shit designed for divine ears\nMy favorite two words from you white boys is, \"Sign here\"\nAnd then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers\nSwear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years\nAnd then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear\nEight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy\nContract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie\nShout out TVGUCCI, my cousin is spooky\nI swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie\nSidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie\nHe claim we don't got a problem but\nNo, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi\nWe might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki\nKawasaki, sushi, sak\u00e9, the money grow on trees like shiitake\nThey tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me\nI'm really on a roll like hamachi\nThe fuck would y'all really do without me?\nFor your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi\nLast time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee\nAnd Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi\nQuavo might've sent me a song that he called \"Versace\"\nI really can't remember it properly\nAll I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties\nTreat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me\nI'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me\nShe could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me\nNiggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me\nNeed to be high-sixin' me\nSwear niggas highkey sick of me\nThey wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently\nFeel like an AMBER Alert the way that I can take her to the mall and she find Tiffany\nI'm like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me\nThey should've been in the fountain based on what y'all wishin' me\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nKnow what I'm sayin'?\nYeah\nMillion-dollar spot (Brr, brr)\nThat's how motherfuckers in CMB play it\nMiddle of the ocean (Blatt)\nJust like that (Shine, shine)\nAll dark fresh green water\nLand that thing\nWith 'bout a hundred hoes\nWe up and we livin' like that, boy\nFresh fly fish like, you understand me, like, real G shit\nYou hear me? A neighborhood superstar\nIt's bigger than anything\nYou know, we start from the bottom, then we come to the top\nGet to the top and we stay up there\nYou hear me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)\nWe look down and we'll be down, but we stayin' up\nAnd we rise up, we stay on 'em, you heard me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)\nBig Florida water, big water ocean\nOn that type of time\nYou understand me?\nRich nigga, rich life, you understand me?\nCome from the bottom, but we come from the bottom (Rich life)\nBut we understand the bottom 'cause we come from it\nAnd we live with it (You understand?)\nGo to our grave 'bout this here, boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)7Embed"

What? Think my heart bulletproof\nYou ain't got a mask, I can show you what a hoodie do\nPull the string tight 'til your eyelids covered too\nI think they on the left, roll the window, hit the lights, boom\nEverybody wish they switched sides when we comin' through\nEverybody wish they was inside when we comin' through\nI pray that you ain't on the other side when we comin' through\nPTSD and I mean it\nNigga, Johnny got killed and I seen it\nI can't fight with these demons\nTop shotta, nigga, I got gunfire for these demons\nHope you know you gotta stand on all that shit you been tweetin'\nTook some real niggas from me, I could kill the whole world and I still won't be even\nI be thinkin' 'bout my brothers while I'm shoppin' in Neiman's\nReal gangster, when I'm gone, carve my name in the cement\nWatch these hoes when you rich, they play games with the semen\nTrials and tribulations, I face them\nProsecutors probably wanna case him\nSee my opps, I jump out and chase them\nI ain't Charleston White, nigga, I'll never Mace them\nLove for all my artists, nigga, I'll never Mase them\nShit, that's probably why they hate him\nTryna get my brother out of jail, I'm like, \"Hey, Kim\"\nCut from a different cloth, he never let it break him\nLook at my advance, it make me wonder, would I make them?\nBut I own my masters, so I can't do shit but thank them\nVideo visits, he be smilin' on FaceTime\nPassionate, I'm talkin' with my hands, these ain't gang signs\nYou don't know Larry, Tayman, or CJ, you ain't one of mine\nBraids on my neck, nigga, I ain't got no hang time\nNigga, I ain't got no kick-it for you\nI don't wanna make friends\nI don't wanna make amends\nI'm chasin' Ms\nYou might also like\nYeah, facts\n212Embed"
