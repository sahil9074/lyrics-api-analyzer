Nipsey\"\n'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones\nMaybe I'm gettin' too stoned\nCalacatta marble for my tombstone\nHere lies a nigga that never lied in his new song\nOr any of his old songs\nThey sing them shits like folk songs\nKumbaya, boom-ba-ye\nKnow the owl stay on me\nBad bitches tryna come through and lay on me\nTryna get the earl grey on me\nBut I ain't really into talkin' names\nOnly tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame\nHeart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame\nHigh fashion and my life is full of climaxes\nAnd my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes\nUp in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses\nThat's how we passin' time\nHundred thousand on the line\nAt the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine\nIt never happens half the time\nMy losing nights are still a vibe\nThat's the things I accept\nYou over there in denial, we not neck and neck\nIt's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct\nMan, fuck a \"Respectfully,\" I just want my respect\nThey tried to label me mean, I say what I mean\nPeople that could've stayed on the team\nThey played in-between\nClouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme\nSome of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems\nHad to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines\nYou niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me\nTold you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please\nI could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees\nHave somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed\nTrust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe\nThat's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya\nThat's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya\nYou know the fourth level of jealousy is called media\nIsn't that an ironic revelation?\nGive that address to your driver, make it your destination\n'Stead of just a post out of desperation\nThis me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation\nWhile you over there tryna impress the nation\nMind's runnin' wild with the speculation\nWhy the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations\nIf we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?\nBut let me digress on behalf of the association\nI'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen\nSee, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages\nIn the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'\nNiggas textin' \"Bro,\" but we are not of no close relation\nI was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment\nSomehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement\nThe greatest in the world, there's no debatin'\nYou boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'\nFar as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages\nLook at the total wages\nAnd look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages\nIf we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases\nToss around Rollies with frozen faces\nThey used to tell me back in the day, \"Boy, you're going places\"\nNever understood where I could really take it\nYeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like22Embed"

That's a hard one\nThe finish line is where I like to pull up and start from\nPain is just a place that I go to get the bars from\nAnxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done\nDelusional's a space I like to think that I'm far from\nMy son is the one thing I hate to be apart from\nBet against me, don't know where they getting the odds from\nI know that when it's done, I'm going wherever God's from\nBut I still don't know where I get the calm from\n(Where I get the calm from) Yeah\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)\nYeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nWoah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah\nYeah (Woah, woah)\nYeah\n\nLook, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes\nI told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied\nI be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line\nAnd I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline\nSometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind\nI can't even hear myself when I get quiet time\nLike, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?\nThey've been tryna push a narrative since '09\nAnd they even had my ass convinced a couple times\nBut that ain't even the half, I had tougher times\nOnly look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes\nAnd it's whatever with them niggas on the other side\nWe got problems we could never really put aside\nI cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside\nI tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die\nSo now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)\nMy hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off\nI'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff\nHouses paid off, label paid off\nMy soul for the money wasn't the trade-off\nUnlike most of you boys that fade off\nI feel guilty taking some days off\nPlease don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off\nI mean, if you comparin' it to what I really made off with\nI'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off\nTrust me it was nothin' light, holmes\nThey tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home\nI know you love me\nCan't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on\nUnless Kawhi wanna run it back\nOther than that, the strings'll be unattached\nCertified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that\nY'all music gets watered down, when you love 'em back\nAnd you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters\nSaid you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard\nOh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more\nSoft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it\nI'm always tryna rekindle\nFrom the bottom to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?\nFrom the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter\nTo my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter\nFor the young Gs out here starting from the beginning\nNobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it (Winning, don't forget it)\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nWoah, woah, woah-woah\nWoah, woah\nWoah, woah-woah, woah\nWoah, woah, ah\nSaid it's hard when it starts to fade away\nSaid it's hard when it starts to fade away\nYeah (Ooh, yeah)\nSaid it's hard when it starts to fade away\nHard when it starts to fade away\nIt's hard when the memories start to fade away\nSaid its hard when the memories start to fade away\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n(Ooh, ooh) So beautiful\nYeah, yeah, yeah16Embed"

Yo, you cheesed me dog\n\nAlways felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture\nCrazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you\nCrazy how even when it miss you\nShit'll come back around and get you\nCrazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas\nRemember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?\nRemember when you had to take the bar exam\nI drove in the snow for you? Yeah\nYou probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah\nYeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then\nBut how 'bout now? (Now)\n'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)\nAnd you stuck right now (Stuck right now)\nOh, you thought you had it all figured out back then\nBut how 'bout now? (Now)\n'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)\nAnd you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)\nYou thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl\nHow 'bout now? Yeah\nGirl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?\nWhat about now, girl, how 'bout now?\n\nMy heart belongs to you...\n\nYeah, always been daddy's little angel\nI bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas\nHe ain't even say thank you\nI had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music\nI used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit\nYou be like \"who's this?\" I be like \"me, girl\"\nYou be like \"oh, word, true shit?\"\nThen ask if we could listen to Ludacris\nThem car rides made me feel like I was losin' it\nYeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that\nOr I was average like that\nStarted drinkin' way more than I used to\nPeople form habits like that, girl\nYeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year\nI'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year\nGuess I just had to pretend that year\nI ain't even see my friends that year\nPlaces that I should've been\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nYeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then\nBut how 'bout now?

Why is it always me?\nGot us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team\n'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas\nGuess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas\nFor real, some nobody started feelin' himself\nA couple somebodies started killin' themself\nA couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf\nI bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help\nI got a gold trophy from the committee for validation\nBad press during the summer over allegations\nI ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money\nThat's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming\nA lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement\nAnd I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear\nFuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga\nFuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous\nWithout me, rap is just a bunch of orphans\nBut if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses\nAnd me and my dread nigga from New Orleans\nStashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings\nEatin' like I\u2019m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's\nNothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco\nThis shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon\nThis shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real\nAll them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills\nAnything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil\nWeezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill\nIf anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real\nComin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase\nBut I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates\nMy weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race\nIt's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe\nNiggas treat me like I've been here for 10\nSome niggas been here for a couple, never been here again\nI'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again\nA young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?\nAyy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again\nIf I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in\nI got her drinkin' with your boy\nI got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like117Embed"

You see, someone gotta lose\nI thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?\nWhat good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?\nAnd what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?\nNight's fallin', lights glowing\nAnd I'm just trying to pay the price owing\nAnd I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing\nAnd I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments\nNigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision\n'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision\nSo I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants\n'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear\nSo can you do me a favor?\nIf I pull it together, make it sooner than later\nWe won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long\nBut please don't move on\n\nYou don't need no one else\nYou don't need no one else\nYou don't need no one else\n(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)\nYou don't need no one else, oh\nYou don't need no one else22Embed"

Yeah\nSweeter the berry, the blacker the juice\nThe boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth\nToo many lyrics 'bout houses and loot\nToo many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs\nI mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?\nI'll let you bring a thousand recruits\nMy peers are a talented group\nBut even if you take all their statistics and carry the two\nEven if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops\nThere's still nothin' they could really do\nIt's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due\nWhenever it's time to recoup\nYeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal\nIn the house playin' D'Angelo, \"How Does It Feel?\"\nI got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die\nWhat you got, time on your hands or time on your side?\nIs there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?\nIs there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?\nYachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies\nIs there more to life than all of these corporate ties\nAnd all of these fortunate times\nAnd all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?\nAm I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?\nLike healin' my soul, like family time\nIs there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?\nIs there more?\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nPassion, instant\nSweat beads, feel me (Feel me)\nCupid's shot me\nMy heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)\nTempt me, drive me (Tempt me)\nIt feels so exciting\nThought of highly (Highly)\nIt's yours entirely\nI'll be, I'll be more than a lover\nMore than a woman\nMore than a lover for you15Embed"

Did I?\nDid I lose you?\nDid I? Did I?\nDid I lose you?\n\nWinnin' is problematic\nPeople like you more when you workin' towards somethin'\nNot when you have it\nWay less support from my peers\nIn recent years as I get established\nUnforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage\nWhy is my struggle different than others'?\nOnly child that\u2019s takin' care of his mother\nAs health worsens and bills double\nThat\u2019s not respectable all of a sudden?\nI don\u2019t get a pat on the back for the come up?\nWhat do you see when you see me?\nWhen did all the things I mean\nFrom the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?\nMaybe I share it with too many people\nBack then it used to just feel like our secret\nBack when I would write and not think about how they receive it\nI be tryna manifest the things I needed\nAnd look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me\nBut you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all\nHow they go from not wantin' me at all\nTo wantin' to see me lose it all?\nThings get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'\nI'm overcome with emotions\nOnes I can't access when I'm stoned sober\nJealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra\nI could only speak what I know of\nMan, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'\nAnd icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'\nAnd puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'\nAll you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies\nEgo strokin', picture postin'\nClaimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only\nBut you just had to show me\nSee, I know, 'cause I study you closely\nI know when someone lyin'\nI notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired\nI know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet\nSometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nDid I?

I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

I got it, I'll take us wherever\nI'm a staple in the game, all my papers together\nAnd my life is on display like Truman\nThey wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner\nMy exes made some of my favorite music\nI dated women from my favorite movies\nKarma's such a thing of beauty\nI'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it\nIt's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters\nI keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever\nI might take a breather but I won't ever leave you\nIf I was you, I wouldn't like me either\nYeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like39Embed"

It's so childish calling my name on the world stage\nYou need to act your age and not your girl's age\nIt gets worse by the annual\nMy career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man\nOh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah\nI know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em\nTo show they outfits off, guess they need the attention\nI remember when it used to be music that did it\nBut then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?\nI'm managed by my friends that I grew up with\nI'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with\nIf me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'\nWe'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on\nBut here we are, yeah\nLately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence\nThey scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments\nBitches alter my messages like we had words\nAnd stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve\nBitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing\nCrazy this year\u2014fuckin' with my image\nI've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year\nFuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year\nAnd I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot\n'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block\nNobody lookin' out for nobody\nMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody\nInstead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it\nAnd then they start to \"R.I.P.\" about it\nAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it\nDamn, I just had to say my piece about it\nOh, you gotta love it\u2014\nBut they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject\nI been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget\nI gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins\nShout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca\nJulia, Ericka, Southern America\nPart of my heritage, pardon my arrogance\nPart in my hair again, that's that comeback flow\nComeback flow, once I start it's apparent\nI'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'\nBut fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement\nYour content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?\nShit is gettin' so personal in your verses too\nI wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas\nBein' number two is just being the first to lose\nMy city dictated music, nobody seein' us\nWinter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up\nBeen observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough\nLet's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup\nYeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all\nYou rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all\n\"Best I Ever Had\" seems like a decade ago\nDecadent flow and I still got a decade to go\nOh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?\nWhy you rappin' like you come from the streets?\nI got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees\nAnd I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves\nPhantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease\nI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese\nSpecial order for anybody that's comin' for me\nShit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze\nYou see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me\nCuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free\nI'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat\nFeel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats\nMan, oh, you gotta love it, yeah\nAnd on top of that it's getting harder to eat\nRappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease\nTo think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me\nAnd now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe\nBut, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)\nYeah\nAnd head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)\nI know your girl well, just not in public\nBlame the city, I'm a product of it\nYoung nigga from the city\nYou gotta love it\nYeah, gotta love it\n*Laughs*\nYeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like298Embed"

That's me on some psychic shit\nI could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts\nBut I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about\nRap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'\nRappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear\nIt's been two years since somebody asked me who I was\nI'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was\nThat's what's important, what really happened before this\nWhen me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans\nSinging, \"Walking like a man, finger on the trigger\nI got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga,\" ah\nWith fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves\nI was pushing myself to get something that I deserve\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\n'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)\nSometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance\nSometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance\nTell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good\nDo me like the women from my town would\nLeather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors\nTalking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for\nMemphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back\nIn Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack\nAnd these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth\nAnd they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South\nAnd every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like\nSo why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?\nSo I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade\nSoon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid\nAnd if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball\nI'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that\nMaking major changes to the life I'm livin'\nI had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\n'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)63Embed"

Lipstick on the glass\nSee, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi\n\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time\nWe must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind\nYou got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)\n\nShower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip\nGuarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship\nAll of them ain't all equipped\nAnd this saddens me, I see the pecking order\nQuote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor\nThose that get laughed at sit off in a corner\nLike a lab rat, nobody want her\nNiggas that are married don't wanna go home\nBut we look up to them, they wish they were us\nThey want some new trim, we lust for some trust\nNow the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener\nWhich leaves your turf in a Boise state\nCan't see a play or the team, 'cause\nEverybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you\nAnd those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, \"That ain't true\"\nAll of them will have an opinion\nBut y'all know what y'all can do with them\nBut if you unsure, I'll take you on tour\nTo a place you can stick that in\nWell, sitting here sad as hell\nListening to Adele, I feel you, baby\n\"Someone Like You,\" more like someone unlike you\nOr something that's familiar maybe\nAnd I can tell that she wants a baby\nAnd I can yell, girl, that you're crazy\nOh, what the hell?

Time for me to revisit the past\nThere's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved\nThere's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn\nInterviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\n\nUh, so much for being optimistic\nThey say love is in the air, so I\nHold my breath 'til my face turn purple\nKeep a few bad bitches in my circle\nMy nuts hang like ain't no curfew\nBitch, if you wave, then I will surf you\nI flew jet, she flew commercial\nBut we still met later that night\nAfter my session, she came over\nI was aggressive and she was sober\nI gave her a pill, she started confessin'\nAnd started undressin' and asked me to hold her\nAnd so I did, but that was last month\nAnd now she's texting me asking for closure, damn\nShe say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper\nWe eat each other whenever we at the dinner table\nShe say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average\nShit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married\nPromises, I hope I never break 'em\nMet a female dragon, had a fire conversation\nBut interviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah\n\nYeah\nYeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah178Embed"

My memory's never faded\nI can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it\nI am still here with who I started with\nThe game needed life, I put my heart in it\nI blew myself up, I'm on some mortar shit\nCarry the weight for my city like a cargo ship\nUh, I'm 23 with a money tree\nGrowing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds\nIt's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist\nAnd that's how she met my pops\nAnd now my garden is enormous\n\"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!\"\nI avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead\nUh-uh, that's word to the millions that they putting up\nI'm trying to do better than good enough\nWhat am I afraid of?\nThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with\nAlways look at me and say the same shit\nThey say \"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\nUh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on\nWhen 40 got some shit for me to snap on\nNow that I'm on I don't really want to worry 'bout getting back on\nI'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on\nI heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home\nAnd I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone\nBut hit \"re-dial\", you'll see that I just called\nSome chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and\nPlus, this woman that I messed with unprotected\nTexted saying she wished she would\u2019a kept it\nThe one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it\nMan, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is\nI'm holding on by a thread\nIt's like I'm high right now, the guy right now\nAnd you could tell by looking in my eyes right now\nThat nothing really comes as a surprise right now\n'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like\nWhat am I afraid of?\nThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with\nAlways look at me and say the same shit\nThey say \"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\nI live by some advice this girl Lissa told me\nThe other day Lissa told me that she miss the old me\nWhich made me question when I went missing\nAnd when I start treating my friends different\nMaybe it was the fast paced switch up\nOr the two guns in my face during the stick up\nMaybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted\nWas who set the whole shit up\nBut in fact, I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up\nI know\nBut same time I'm quick to forget\nI'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets\nBurn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh\n'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed\nDid I just trade free time for camera time?\nWill I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?\nYeah, I just need some closure\nAin't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over32Embed"

Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club\nDamn, that nigga always kept it so hood\nBack when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods\nAnd have girls fall through like coins in the couch\nNow we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about\nScared for the first time, everything just clicked\nWhat if I don't really do the numbers they predict?\nConsidering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked\nTo write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick\nBut if I really do it don't expect to get a split\nCause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get\nI'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in\nThrowing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen\nBut still throwing touchdown passes\nIn tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it\nPeople say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it\nBut they need to be a little more specific\nIs this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression\nDucking your questions, fuck your suggestions\nMoney gets all of my love and affection\nCars all black like the cover of Essence\nI'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze\nY.M.O.E. nigga, yeah\nUh, yeah, this what yall want\nOctobers Very Own\nYoung Money\nATF\nThank me later in this bitch wasssup\nFree Weezy in this bitch wasup\nJune 15th in this bitch wasup\nNoel That\u2019s it AhhhhhhSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $162You might also like51Embed"
